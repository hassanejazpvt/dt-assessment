# Refactoring Readme
## Introduction
Greetings and good health to everyone!

I have conducted a review and refactoring of the code in the following files within the Laravel application:

1. `refactor/app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php`
2. `refactor/app/Repository/BookingRepository.php`


## Changes Made
### 1. Authentication Handling
   In the BookingController, I replaced the usage of $request->__authenticatedUser with auth() to retrieve the current user. Additionally, I adhered to PHP naming conventions, using authenticatedUser as the variable name without double underscores (__).

### 2. Improved Response Handling
   I introduced a trait named ResponseTrait to facilitate consistent response handling. This trait provides methods like success, error, and exception for returning responses in JSON format when dealing with APIs or loading views in the controller's response for other cases.

### 3. Error Handling
   To enhance error handling, I enclosed controller methods in try...catch blocks. This approach enables the catching of specific errors and exceptions, allowing various actions such as logging to a database, sending emails or Slack messages, or using third-party services like Bugsnag for error reporting.

### 4. Introduction of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
   To transform request data into objects, I recommend using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). This approach allows for easy adaptation to changes in request parameters, providing flexibility for future modifications.

### 5. Service Classes
   I refactored the logic within controllers by creating service classes. These classes transform data from DTOs or requests into model-mapped data, simplifying the interaction with repository methods. The BaseService class was introduced to provide basic methods like create, update, and find.

### 6. FormRequest Classes
   I advocated for the use of Laravel's FormRequest classes for data validation. The ApiRequest class, extended by StoreJobRequest, offers default configurations to be used in each FormRequest extending it.

### 7. Enums Implementation
   While PHP 8 supports native ENUMs, I provided a workaround for PHP 7 by creating classes with constants to mimic ENUMs. This approach enhances the flexibility of static values, making them easier to update across the codebase.

### 8. Code Documentation
   In each method, I ensured the inclusion of the following:

- **Doc Blocks:** Comments above methods describing arguments, types, exceptions, and return value types.
- **Type Hinting:** Type declarations for variables in method arguments.
- **Return Type:** Explicit definition of the expected response type.

### Incomplete Refactoring
Note that not all methods have undergone refactoring, but the outlined changes serve to streamline and enhance the flexibility of the application. This pattern aims to reduce code redundancy and maintain a clean, organized codebase.
